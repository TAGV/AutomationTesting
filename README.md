# Automation Testing

The aim of this project is to learn Automation testing using Selenium webdriver and Python.

## *Description*

This project is a self-learning initiative to learn web automation, using Selenium webdriver(open source tool).
We will use python as a programming language to implement the automation scripts. Also
further,we will use python pytest framework to create our test suite and run the automation
tests.

## *Prerequisites*

Following are the requirements before we start with our project:

1. Python language basics
2. Setting up of IDE(Pycharm in my case)
3. Selenium webdriver using any browser(Firefox in my case)
4. Git fundamentals
5. Linux OS(Few commands are run through linux terminal)

    * Understanding open source pytest framework
    * Basic pytest template to set up and run test case using:
        * linux terminal
        * Pycharm IDE
    * Selenium tests using pytest:
        * Running a single test
        * Running suite of tests
        * Running tests in parallel
